### Databases project (SQL) 

This repository contains a project developed for a university 
Databases class. The goal was to build a functional relational 
database to manage a fictional store's stock and sales system, 
including ER modeling, SQL scripting, and reporting.

How to run:

    > Open the SQL files in the `script` folder using your 
    preferred DBMS (e.g., MySQL Workbench).
    
    > Run the scripts to create and populate the database.
    
    > Use the provided queries to generate reports and interact 
    with the system.
